# Smart-Energy-Meter-Using-GSM
<br>
1.The project is done in the PROTEUS VIRTUAL SIMULATOR.<br>
2.The code is worked in ARDUINO IDE. <br>
3.The Libraries that should be included in the ARDUINO IDE were attached with the folder name "Libraries".
<br>
4.Befor Using GSM Module , attach/include the ".hex" file given in the folder "GSM hex file" in the proteus GSM tool.
<br>
5.Compile the code in the ARDUINO IDE and include the compiled ".hex" file in the Arduino tool in the proteus.
<br>
6.Compile the Arduino Code in ARDUINO IDE before every execution to get current and accurate  time and date.
<br>
7.There is a tool error in RTC Module where the time runs slower than the current / actual time , we may get some delay in the displayed on the terminal.
